# zig-wasm-kde
Kernel Density Estimates in WASM via Zig

# Purpose
At the moment the project's goal is for the principal author to learn Zig, JS, WASM, and WebGL. This document will be updated if and when that changes.

# Use
Running `zig build` from the project root and launching a web server from `zig-cache/bin` will display the current state of the project.
